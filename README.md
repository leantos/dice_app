# dice_app

Dice App is a very simple flutter program that I created to learn about

- Stateless Widgets
- Stateful Widgets
- Random Values usign dart.math package
- Conditional Rendering using onClick and useState()
- Gradients in Flutter

The application will display randomized images of a dice on click on a button.
